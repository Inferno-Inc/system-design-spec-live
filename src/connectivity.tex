\subsection{Connectivity Requirements}

The following requirements should be met to ensure proper operation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wired connection with 100 MBit/s symmetric link to the internet
    \item Low latency connection to next internet hop (<5ms)
    \item No data volume limitations
\end{itemize}

Even this document requires a 100MBit/s connection, that connection will not be saturated by the node. You can expect ~10-30MBit/s \footnote{TODO: need to verify} when the chain is under load. 
Traffic will mainly flow on port 30303 (udp/tcp). If chosen to run on a cloud provider, EWF NetOps needs to be consulted to select an appropriate hosting region to ensure node distribution across multiple regions.
If chosen to run on-premise, EWF NetOps has to be informed about the hosting location to ensure proper global distribution decisions can be made.
The hosting location should be chosen to be as close as possible to one of the major internet exchanges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Germany/Continental Europe/USA - DE-CIX / AMS-IX
    \item United Kingdom - LINX
\end{itemize}
