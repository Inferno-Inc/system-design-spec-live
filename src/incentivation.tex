The EWF chain knows four levels on nodes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The double-validator with an active sealer and a shadow node
    \item The single validator with only the active sealer
    \item A support node running a non-sealing full node along with an IPFS and InCubed server. Support nodes don't need to fulfill the higher security standards that validator nodes need to provide.
    \item plain non-validator nodes, which are just normal blockchain client nodes that don't need to adhere to any increased security standards. They can be run by anybody and therefore are not part of these guidelines.
\end{itemize}

Best case scenario would be that every affiliate runs the double validator configuration along with a separate support node. This would take 3 separate hosts the affiliate has to maintain.
Each affiliate should at least run a support node as it the easiest configuration to run and to secure.

The target for the active validator set should be at 25 validator nodes with the same amount of shadow nodes.
