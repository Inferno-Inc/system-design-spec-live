\section{Normal Operations [Procedure proposal]}

After the node joined the authority network, it has to be maintained. It is the Affiliates responsibility to ensure that the node always adheres to the requirements and guidelines outlined in this document.
EWF Network Operations can only play a supportive role.

Node telemetry is automatically processed to detect failed or unmaintained nodes. The following Process applies if a node becomes unstable or unavailable:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The telemetry system will inform EWF NetOps and the designated contact of the affiliate about an instability
    \item The affiliate has to restore service to the node in 24 hours
    \item The affiliate should send an explanation about the malfunction to EWF NetOps \footnote{Necessary to detect potential system-wide issues}
    \item If after 24 hours the node is still not back to normal operation the affiliate has to contact EWF NetOps with the reason of the malfunction and an estimated schedule when the node is back to normal operation
    \item If the affiliate does not contact EWF NetOps in the aforementioned time frame, NetOps will escalate the issue to GovOps. GovOps then has to decide within 48h to remove the authority node from the list of validators.
    \item NetOps will provide an incident report if the issue was severe/noteworthy
\end{enumerate}
