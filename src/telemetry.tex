\section{Telemetry}

Authority nodes have to send automatic telemetry data to NetOps. This helps detecting attacks or other network disturbances early.
The following telemetry is collected and send through a secure channel (see Telemetry Signer and Ingress in \ref{components}) to EWF NetOps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU usage
    \item Memory usage
    \item Disk usage
    \item Number of connected blockchain peers
    \item List of visible P2P peers
    \item Current block
    \item Network latency to 3 different and major locations (eg. cloudflare, google, amazon)
    \item Network throughput
    \item Network error rate
    \item Number of SSH keys \footnote{Used to detect addition of keys}
    \item Service status for SSH, Docker and the Parity container
    \item SHA256 hashes of key system components/binaries
    \item Current chain specification (file or hash)
\end{itemize}
